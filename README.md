# MultipleFileExtractor
I made this project because I am taking a course where I need to frequently unzip files and place them in a chosen directory 

1. Created backend with Express.js
2. Use multer's storage to handle multiple file uploads
3. Created a post request that iterates over every uploaded file and unzips them using AdmZip in a location specified in the form's text body 
4. Tested the application's functionality using Postman
5. Application is ready for me to use on port 8000
